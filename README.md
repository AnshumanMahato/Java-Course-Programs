# JAVA COURSE TUTORIALS

This repo contains programs/projects that I made while learning JAVA. I followed the course of [CodeWithHarry-YT](https://www.codewithharry.com/videos/java-tutorials-for-beginners-1). This repo also contains notes that are provided by him.<br>
**Note:- I am using vscode as my code editor. But the course suggests using IntelliJ. You may choose as per your convenience. If you are a beginner and do not have much understanding of IDEs and Code Editors, I suggest following the directions given in the course**
